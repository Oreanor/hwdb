Every version of the car had a die-cast body, die-cast chassis, redline wheels, bent-axle suspension, and Spectraflame paint. The casting was originally available in only two colors, Spectraflame Blue and Spectraflame Orange. Subsequent releases expanded the colors. Like many of the other original 16, The Custom Cougar had details in the first run that were left off in subsequent runs. For the Cougar it was the painted \"tooth.\" The center part of the grill was painted the same as the body color. This only happened on the early runs. Also early run cars had color-keyed interiors. The Blue Cougar with a blue interior is fairly common. Later issues find it with any of the other assorted color interiors. Black roofs were found on the Cougars, also. Only some Hong Kong casting came with the \"vinyl\" top. The Olive Cougar is one that commonly has the black roof. The Cars were packaged with a 'Collector's Button'."

It features a die-cast body and chassis (base) and an opening hood which reveals a detailed engine. The Cars were packaged with a 'Collector's Button'. The Custom T-Bird was manufactured in both the USA and Hong Kong production facilities and there are several differences between the two. USA versions were produced with clear glass and silver wheels, while Hong Kong (HK) had blue tinted glass and chrome wheels (all T-Birds came with 'Bearing' style Redline wheels). HK cars had an unpainted bare metal grille, and USA cars had a black painted grille which could be found completely painted black, or with the Thunderbird emblem unpainted. The front fender wells of USA T-Birds are larger and higher cut than their HK counterparts and the cowls are also larger. The Custom T-Bird featured painted rear taillights with USA versions painted in a metallic darker red and HK with a bright flat red. There are several differences between USA and HK bases, most notably the lack of suspension detail and four square holes (to view the bent-axel suspension) on the USA version, there are also multiple variations of the layout and size of the copyright information. Multiple colored interiors could be found on the Custom T-Bird. USA interiors could be found in White, Tan or Dark Brown and HK interiors in White, Olive &amp; Gray, Gray &amp; Brown, Silver and Brown. Hong Kong cars had a seperate black steering wheel while USA cars had the steering wheel molded into the plastic. The Custom T-Bird was painted in a wide variety of Spectraflame colors of which there are a handful of hard-to-find and rare versions. All Hong Kong cars and most USA cars came with a black painted roof which simulated the vinyl roof of the real car. USA 'No-Black-Roof' (NBR) cars are fairly uncommon and most notably the Spectraflame Gold NBR with a white interior, which could only be found in 1968 Store Displays. During the end of the Custom T-Bird's production, the USA casting was modified in preparation for the TNT-Bird. The modified casting featured 'Door Lines' and are very rare. In 2018, the Custom T-Bird was re-tooled for the HotWheelsCollectors.com Original 16 Series based on the original Hong Kong version."

It seems both would be a big hit. Interiors come in assorted colors, with the most interesting, the early Hong Kong casting having matching colors Blue on Blue and Antifreeze on Dark Green. Early USA bases had the four open hole design, like their counterparts in Hong Kong, but they were a bean shape hole. Known as the Kidney Bean Base. Another version is the tabbed base. USA cars do not have door-lines, but the Hong Kong casting does. Early Hong Kong has a painted tail, same color as the car. Early Hong Kong cars have deep-dish wheels, some all four, some just the front two. Some have been found with Heavy Chevy windows. It is suggested that no other car has more variations than this car. There was no \"series\" in 1968. Just the regular line-up. So collector's call it the \"Sweet 16\" or \"Original 16\". They were packaged with a 'Collector's Button'."

The Cars were packaged with a metal 'Collector's Button'. Sky Show Deora was a vehicle released in 1970. This re-issued Deora was only available in the Sky Show race sets, along with the Sky Show Fleetside. Mattel retooled the 1968 casting of the Deora&#160; for this release. The tonneau cover area had an orange ramp attached to it; the ramp extended out over the front of the roofline and hood, and held one of three different colored airplanes (blue, green and yellow all came with the set). The planes locked into a hole in the ramp under the tension provided by an elastic band at the front of the ramp. As the vehicle traveled down the track, the plane was released via a trigger on the ramp. The Sky Show Deora was made only in Hong Kong and released only in Canada. It was actually released with the name Aero Launcher Deora, but is commonly referred to by collectors as the Sky Show Deora. In 2000, Nathan Proch designed a sequel to this casting, named the Deora II. It was loosely based on the original, but more streamlined and aerodynamic. Three years later, a full-size working version of the Deora II was built, bringing the legend of the Deora full-circle. The Deora is most recognized for its two detachable plastic surfboards. This casting is the only model from the Redline era to have four small Redline tires."

It is based off the real-life 1967 Plymouth Barracuda. It was manufactured in 1968 and 1969 at both the USA and Hong Kong factories, with some casting&#160;differences between the two countries of origin. USA manufactured cars have clear glass and Hong Kong (HK) cars have blue tinted glass. USA Barracudas have a detailed interior which includes a dashboard and with a molded in steering wheel while HK cars have a flat piece of plastic representing the dashboard with a separate&#160;black steering wheel. USA cars could be found with a white or dark brown interior, while Hong Kong cars could be found with a white, brown-ish/gray, dark brown, silver or purple interior. Purple interiors are usually found in matching purple exterior cars, but have been known to appear (rarely) in Copper and Aqua cars. The Custom Barracuda features an opening hood which reveals a detailed engine. USA cars have shorter 'power bulges' (hood scoops) and a thinner cowl than their Hong Kong counterparts. Some early HK manufactured cars could also be found with deeper power bulges than usual, these have only been found on Aqua and Purple cars. Hong Kong cars have a detailed base including&#160;four square holes to view the Bent Axle Suspension, these holes are absent from USA built vehicles. There are also several minor base variations involving the size and addition of&#160;™ and&#160;© symbols. Some Custom Barracudas use a mix of parts from both USA and Hong Kong are are referred to as 'Hybrids'. Most 'Hybrid' Custom Barracudas use the USA body, glass and interior with a Hong Kong base. These are much harder to find than standard cars. This oddity was most likely due to material shortages or problems, which required parts to be shipped between factories.&#160; The Custom Barracuda was painted in a variety of Spectraflame colors, some of which are very rare. Unlike most early 'Redline Era' cars, the Custom Barracuda was never manufactured with a black roof.&#160;All Custom Barracudas came with delrin 'Bearing' Redline wheels, with some early produced vehicles from Hong Kong sporting 'Deep Dish'&#160;wheels on the front. All came packaged with a metal 'Collector's Button'. In 1970, the Custom Barracuda was significantly modified and renamed King Kuda, and was released in the Spoilers series. Most notably, the King Kuda featured an&#160;exposed blown engine, replacing the one under the opening hood. It also came with the addition of prominent front and rear spoilers.&#160; In 2011, the Custom Barracuda was re-tooled for the HotWheelsCollectors.com RLC Membership. This casting appears to be based on the original USA casting. The re-tooled version has been used several times since."

The Chevy Fleetside was designed by Harry Bradley and based on his own heavily customized 1964 Chevy El Camino. This is the car all other Hot Wheels were styled after \"with that California Custom look\". Red stiped tires, custom details. Early Hong Kong bases were painted the same color as the main body under the tail of the car. The Cars were packaged with a Collector's Button. The casting was released again in 1970 (with a few minor alterations), as the Sky Show Fleetside. After this version, the original tool was no longer used. On the Custom Fleestside, the interior does not stretch into the bed area, and there is no square hole cut into the truck bed. There is a divider partition flush with the back of the cab, then a gap (to allow the tonneau cover to raise up and down) and then the back wall of the truck bed. The taillights are painted vertically on the Custom Fleetside. The Custom Fleetsides were all painted with black roofs. In 2003, the Custom Fleetside tool was recreated and released at the 17th Annual Hot Wheels Collectors Convention. Sky Show Fleetside Description The Sky Show Fleetside was a car issued as part of the Sky Show boxed sets, along with the Sky Show Deora. The Sky Show Fleetside had an orange ramp that replaced the bed cover, that launched either a helicopter or plane. It came in the \"Sky Show\" or the \"Flyin' Circus\" sets only. It is decorated with white checkered-flag stickers on the doors on both sides saying \"Sky Show \". The same base/chassis is used for both the Sky Show Fleetside and the Custom Fleetside.&#160; There is no diffrence between the bases, they both read \"Custom Fleetside\". The cosmetic difference between the Sky Show Fleetside and the normal Custom Fleetside is in the truck bed design. On the Sky Show Fleetside, the interior shelf/dashboard of the cab behind the seats extends from the cab, past the roof pillars, and into the box area a few millimeters. It looks like a small shelf when the ramp is removed. There is also a small square hole cut into the Sky Show Fleetside's cargo bed under the ramp, right against the rear of the cab. Another clue to the Sky Show Fleetside, is the taillights are painted horizontally onto the top side of the base, towards the upper part of the tailgate. Sky Show Fleetsides never had black-painted roofs. On the Custom Fleestside, the interior does not stretch into the bed area, and there is no square hole cut into the truck bed. There is a divider partition flush with the back of the cab, then a gap (to allow the tonneau cover to raise up and down) and then the back wall of the truck bed.

    "desc": "With the continuing success of the GT40 MkI and MkII, for the 1966 Season, Ford sought to make a lighter and more aerodynamic version of the GT40. The result was the Ford J-Car. Unlike the previous versions of the GT40, the J-Car was built in the USA by Kar Kraft. It still retained the 427ci 7.0L 'Big Block' from the MkII, but the body and chassis were ditched for a 'breadvan' design with a honeycomb aluminum tub chassis.&#160; One car was built and was sent to Le Mans 1966 for testing where it posted the fastest time in practice sessions. Despite this, Ford decided to race the GT40 MkII which had proven reliability, and fortunately so because they came away victorious with a 1-2-3 finish.&#160; After Le Mans, development continued on the J-Car project with another car being constructed. Driven by Ken Miles (1966 Le Mans 2nd Place) during a testing session, the J-Car suddenly lost control and the end of Riverside Raceway's one mile long straight. Spearing off the track and over an embankment, the car hit the ground and flew end-over-end several times, ejecting Miles, before coming to rest and bursting into flames, totally destroying the car and killing Miles. After the accident, a more conventional and aerodynamic design with a stronger chassis was implemented, known as the Ford MkIV. The Hot Wheels Ford J-Car was designed by Harry Bradley, and debuted in the 1968 Lineup as part of the 'Original 16'&#160;castings. It was painted in various 'Spectraflame' colors as well as white enamel, mimicking the real car. It features an opening rear hatch which displays the engine and #1 racing stickers and stripes. It was manufactured in both the USA and Hong Kong factories, with some differences between the two. USA cars only came with clear windows, had an unpainted metal base, and most commonly a black interior (Dark Brown and Tan can be found). Hong Kong cars came with blue windows, a painted base which extends to the sides of the car and only black interiors.&#160; Some early produced Hong Kong J-Cars could be found with vents in the top of the hatch, these were omitted later in production. Also, some cars have what is known as a 'Hidden Hinge' where the hinge for the rear hatch is designed in a way that cannot&#160;be seen, this is only found on early production Hong Kong cars. Another variation is the size of the steering wheel, again, this is only found on Hong Kong cars. Early USA built cars have a hatch that opens completely, while later in production a stopper was added to prevent this from happening.&#160; The 'Enamel Blue' version of the J-Car is rumored to have been a promotional give-away at the 1969 Indianapolis 500, although there is no evidence to back up these claims. Contrary to the name, these cars are actually Spectraflame blue, painted over the top of white enamel. The 'Original 16'&#160;castings were packaged with a metal 'Collector's Button'. In 2010, the Ford J-Car was retooled for the HotWheelsCollectors.com Series 9 Neo Classics Series.&#160;"

According to lore, because of the fact that Harry Bradley worked for GM shortly before moving to Mattel, he snuck out copies of the blueprints into his cane (he had polio) for the real '68 Stingray and used them as a base for the Hot Wheels model. Since he was a designer there, he knew exactly where to get the materials for designing these new \"Hot Wheels\" in 1967; when the casting was released, GM \"was not happy\". When the first 16 Hot Wheels debuted in the summer of 1968 (the Custom Corvette was one of them), the cat was out of the bag, as Chevrolet's 1968 Corvette was not due out for another few months still. This worked out in a good way, as it created more hype for Chevrolet and the Stingray from both kids and adults alike.

The real-life Beatnik Bandit was built on a shortened 1950 Oldsmobile chassis and featured a&#160;fiberglass custom body, complete with a bubble-top which doubled as both the roof and door. It also featured a unique 'control stick' which operated the acceleration, brakes, steering and gear changes. The car still exists today and is on permanent display at the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada. The original 'Redline Era' version of the Beatnik Bandit was manufactured from 1968 to 1971 in both the USA and Hong Kong factories. There are several differences between USA and 'HK' manufactured cars. USA cars have a clear glass dome and the 'control stick' interior while HK produced vehicles have blue tinted glass and a black steering wheel. USA cars have engines with dual injectors while HK engines have a blower on top. Hong Kong cars have four square openings in the base which show the Bent Axle Suspension, these holes are absent from USA vehicles. Also Hong Kong cars have a slightly larger grille and headlights. They were painted in various 'Spectraflame' colors, some of which are very hard to find. They could also be found with either a White, Gray or Dark Brown interior. They were packaged with a metal 'Collector's Button'. In 1993, the Beatnik Bandit was revived for the 25th Anniversary Series, which replicated original 'Redline Era' vehicles, including several colors of each car replicating the original Spectraflame colors. The following year, it was released in the Vintage Series, again in several colors. Both the 25th Anniversary and Vintage releases were packaged with a replica plastic 'Collector's Button'. This casting was used a few times before being retired and again re-tooled for HotWheelsCollectors.com. In 2002, a more detailed version of the Beatnik Bandit was created, this time including an opening 'bubble-top'. This version was only used once."

It was originally built with four wheel disc brakes, independent rear suspension, front coil springs and a fuel injected 283 Chevrolet engine. This extremely popular show car won several First Place trophies in its day. Not the least of which were 1st in the Winternationals the first time entered, a 1st in the Oakland Roadster Show (Grand National Roadster Show is the true name), and many other shows in that era. The real car is currently owned by Hot Wheels collector Bruce Pascal. The Hot Heap came from 2 different plants (US and Hong Kong) there are several ways to tell the difference in the two castings. In the US casting, the engine was set forward with a round transmission hump at the beginning with the transmission hump becoming square towards the end of the run in 1971. The base was fairly plain with no details other than the exhaust pipes and the logos on it (Hot Wheels logo, US patents pending, etc.) The trunk was shorter on the US version and the leaf spring on the back was shorter and less detailed. The wheels also had a duller finish to the chrome plating. It came with a clear windshield. The Hong Kong casting had an engine that was set back against the firewall. The base was more detailed with the entire drive train molded into the base. The chrome on the wheels was shinier. The trunk was longer and the leaf spring on the back was longer and more detailed. It had a Blue-tinted windshield."

It is recognized as Hot Wheels's first original design, done from the ground up at Mattel with no external input. It features a doorless canopy design, with entry and egress done through an opening canopy up top, as well as two large big block engines. Today, Twin Mill is a highly popular model and is often considered the most iconic Hot Wheels model, alongside other models like the Bone Shaker. Twin Mill's first release was painted in several Spectraflame colors and came with Redline wheels. It was manufactured in the USA and could be found with either a white or dark brown interior. The twin motors have a gold tint. The base can be seen from the top of the car and was painted in body color. They were packaged with a metal 'Collector's Button'. Some early pre-production prototypes have what is known as a 'Cut Fender' where the rear fenders are much smaller and do not cover the rear wheels entirely. This adheres to the original design made by Ira. They are very hard to find and have been found in Antifreeze, Orange, Red, Light 'Apple' Green and Creamy Pink. 1973 saw Twin Mill released as a Shell Promo, a giveaway promotional car handed out to customers at Shell service stations. As with other 1973 cars, it lost its Spectraflame paint which was replaced with enamel paint. In 1976 the Twin Mill was renamed Twin Mill II, although having no changes to the casting itself. It was only used in 1976 and 1977.&#160; The casting was retooled in 1993 for use in the Vintage to celebrate Hot Wheels's 25th anniversary. A highly-detailed version was also introduced in the 100% Hot Wheels series in 1998. Earlier in the 1970s, Italian toy company Mebetoys also released its own take on the Twin Mill in 1/55 scale. It has led to six other follow-up castings, the Twin Mill II and Twin Mill III and has spawned a number of derivatives, such as a 'Tooned Noppo-style version, a Hardnoze version, an all-electric version and a Monster Truck. Twin Mill featured as car #17 of the Highway 35 anniversary event, driven by Pete Karris from the Road Beasts team. This version of the car was given top billing on the cover of the tie-in game. The casting was retooled with a plastic base in 2018 for use in the Hot Wheels id series."

It is only beaten by its unreleased predecessor, the Rear-Loading Beach Bomb Prototype.&#160; Although it had a very small factory test production of an estimated 200, the RLBB was not mass-produced and shipped to stores because its' high center of gravity made it prone to tipping off the track, and it was too narrow for the Supercharger to grab its sides and propel the casting properly. At the time period, track sets and superchargers were hot-sellers and every kid had one. The Beach Bomb not being able to make it through them was a big deal. As a result, the casting was sent back to the drawing board and modified with two pods on the sides (disguised as surfboard holders) to widen it so the supercharger would grab it. A large square chunk of solid metal was molded into the middle of the base to keep the van weighed-down, and a large portion of the roof was removed and turned into a plastic sunroof to further lower the center of gravity.

The model was packaged with a metal or plastic Collector's Button. The Demon was renamed Prowler (variously named in sources as either Prowler or The Prowler) in 1973 due to apparent complains from religious parents. It came in various assorted enamel colors, which were used due to the safety issues associated with the lead paint used for the older Spectraflame colors which were retired the same year for safety reasons. Straight axles were used as opposed to bent axles to cut further costs. The casting got a new tool &amp; die to be&#160;released as The Demon in 1993 for the 25th Anniversary Series and current reissues.

Based on the 1969 Ford Maverick with a lot more flare, the model sported such features as a V8 motor under the hood which was not offered in the real Ford Maverick until two years later in 1971, as well as \"nose-down\" suspension setup and a massive rear spoiler to give the car a drag-ready appearance. It was originally named 'Mad Maverick' during the prototype and pre-production stages. A few models exist with the 'Mad Maverick' name on the base and are very rare. According to one source, five such models are known to exist - two blue, one red, one purple, and one with no paint that was never assembled. All five are believed to be in private collections and are considered nearly priceless. The name was changed due to Johnny Lightning having a Ford Maverick also named 'Mad Maverick'.&#160; It was manufactured in both the USA and Hong Kong and released with a large plastic wing on the rear and an opening hood and were packaged with a metal 'Collector's Button'. USA cars came with a wide printed white stripe on the roof, clear glass and an all-black grille, while Hong Kong cars had a thin sticker white stripe, blue glass and a black grille with silver headlights. Some USA cars have been found with a black stripe, though these may possibly be pre-production cars. Some Hong Kong cars in Orange and Copper came with brown rear wings and interiors, these are very hard-to-find. Some Hong Kong cars also came with a matte-black painted roof with the white stripe applied over the top.&#160; The rear wing is often missing, and such has been accurately reproduced.&#160;Collectors commonly state that the rear wing of the Hong Kong cars was made of a more brittle plastic and is more likely to be missing. The Mighty Maverick was produced in Mexico by CIPSA and is one of the most common CIPSA cars. The 1973 Street Snorter is a retooled version of the Mighty Maverick, as with most 1973 models cost saving methods were used in the retooling. The rear wing was removed and the spectraflame paint was replaced with enamel paint, though the hood still opened. Capped redline wheels were used on the rear and open axle redlines in the front. In 1973, the wing was removed and the car was renamed Street Snorter&#160;and in 1975 it returned to the Mighty Maverick name, still without the wing. Reintroduced into the line-up in 1975. The Mighty Maverick a re-issue of the Mighty Maverick (1970). Missing the rear wing like it's cousin the '73 Street Snorter. Still giving you that feeling that it was quick out of the hole and a strong 1/4 mile run look, with the bulged hood, short stance. Just missing the wheelie-bars. Hood cast shut.

The Red Baron is one of the more popular Hot Wheels models released; even featuring in Pixar's Toy Story. The origin story of the Red Baron is complex. Originally a Monogram model kit, a show car version was commissioned, built in a six month timespan, and unveiled in early 1969. The Hot Wheels version then debuted a year later, in 1970; with added fenders not present in the original. The initial version of the car featured 'Capped' Redline wheels, Spectraflame red paint, and a pointed spike on the helmet; it was packaged with either a metal, or rarer plastic, Collector's Button. Additionally, for a short time Mattel owned Monogram; and the Hot Wheels version of the Red Baron was included as a bonus in some model kit boxes. Some 1970 Red Barons have been found with a white interior instead of the normal black interior. These are very rare, and only a handful are known to exist. They have been found with a completely blank base, or with the copyright information found on the regular release; it is unknown whether these were a pre-production prototype or a very small production run.&#160;Michael Zarnock's \"Warman's Hot Wheels Field Guide: 3rd Edition (Values and Identification)\", notes this variant as the fifth rarest Hot Wheel to date, with an estimated value of&#160;$3,000 or more. So far, no Red Barons with a white interior have been found in the original packaging. (Note: The Red Baron has been re-released with a white interior, and these are NOT worth the above stated value!) In 1973, the Red Baron's Spectraflame paint was replaced with flat enamel paint, and the front wheels were changed to the newer 'Hole-Through' style Redline. The rear wheels stayed the 'Capped' style Redline wheels, and the pointed helmet spike remained.&#160;One year after that, due to safety concerns, the pointed spike was dulled to a small bump; this version was found with the Capped/Hole-Through combination of wheels from the 1973 version, but more commonly with all four Hole-Through wheels. The Red Baron was then produced with Blackwall wheels in the 1977 Flying Colors Series, 1979 Classy Customs Series and the 1983 Mainline series. All of these versions are identical, except for the card.&#160; In 1993, The Red Baron was re-tooled for the 25th Anniversary Series and has been used many times until 2012. In 2002, it additionally got a smaller, more detailed version closer to the original model and hot rod in appearance as part of the 100% Hot Wheels series, produced once for a 2-Pack before 100% castings were discontinued. The Red Baron featured as car #31 of the Highway 35 anniversary event, driven by Harrison Lau from the Scorchers team."

Dune Daddy's can be found with either a mixture of 'Capped' and 'hole-through' redline wheels or 'Hole-through' wheels on all four. Interiors can be found in Black, Dark Brown, Champagne or White.

The series of cars (Swingin' Wing, Warpath, Volkswagen,&#160;Dune Daddy) were originally slated for a soap promotion for Proctor &amp; Gamble from 1975, but the deal fell through and the cars, which were already produced, sat in a Mattel warehouse until the Wisconsin Toy Co. bought them. This explains why they had Redline wheels, even after they were discontinued in 1977. They were sold inexpensively in a plastic baggie with a cardboard header.

USA built cars had clear windows while Hong Kong produced cars have blue tinted windows. It came with a black roll-cage and body prop underneath its opening body.

Decals featuring a pair of glasses with \"Bye-Focal\" written on it are factory-applied on the driver's side, with an extra optional sticker to be applied by the user, also included in the package was a plastic 'Collector's Button'. It was painted in various&#160;Spectraflame colors, of which Purple is the hardest to find and is regarded as one of the rarest of all Redline Hot Wheels from the Spectraflame Era (1968-1972). Due to shade differences in the Spectraflame painting process, the existence of a Spectraflame Olive version receives skepticism by collectors and is generally believed to be&#160;merely a regular Spectraflame Yellow which has 'Toned' (dulling of the metal) rather than a completely separate color. The Bye-Focal is known to have issues with a metal fatigue called 'Crumbling' where the body or chassis develops cracks and literally crumbles into pieces. In 1973, the Bye Focal was released with the clear hood removed and was renamed as the Show-Off.&#160; In 2003, the Bye-Focal was re-tooled for the&#160;HotWheelsCollectors.com Series 2 Super Chromes."

It is based on the classic American car, the Cord Model 812, nicknamed the 'Coffin Nose'. The Classic Cord is a favourite among collectors and it's run of only two years (1971-1972) makes it relatively hard to find in any colour. According to Jack Parker, a former Mattel design engineer, the Classic Cord was selected specifically to 'target' the collector market. For its initial release, it was only manufactured in&#160;the USA and all came with a clear windshield, black interior and a removable black roof. It also features an opening hood which has a supercharger sticking out.&#160;As with most plastic parts from the era, the Classic Cord's roof has been reproduced. An original roof will have the serial&#160;number 6472-0510 on the underside. The Model Cars were packaged with a plastic 'Collector's Button'. It was painted in various&#160;Spectraflame colors, of which Pink and Salmon are&#160;the hardest to find. Due to shade differences in the Spectraflame painting process, some cars have been nicknamed 'Berry', these cars are a lighter shade of purple verging on pink and are usually not recognised as a completely separate color. A handful of prototypes exist, with some having an orange roof. The Classic Cord was also manufactured in Mexico by CIPSA. These versions are very hard to find and are often found in poor condition.

It is a modified 'hot-rodded' version with not one, but two blown V8 engines. One in the front and one in the rear bed. It features a removable white plastic roof and an assortment of tools cast into the side of the vehicle: pick, shovel, canteen, gas can, tool box etc. Its initial release&#160;was only manufactured at the USA production facility and all came with a black interior and a light-gray tinted glass. It came packaged with a metal or plastic 'Collector's Button'.&#160; It was painted in a variety of Spectraflame colors.

It is unknown whether they are separate colors rather than darker shades of Spectraflame Yellow and Spectraflame Red. In 1974, the Grass Hopper was re-tooled without the second rear engine and removable roof, and in 1975 it was re-tooled again without any engines. Both the 1974 and 1975 versions also had the tools removed. The 1975 version was released in Italy by Mebetoys in a small cardboard box. In 1975, a modified version was released called the Gun Slinger. This vehicle was modeled after the 1975 version with no blown motors, except this time it had an enormous machine gun mounted in the rear. The Grass Hopper was re-tooled and re-released in 2010 for the HotWheelsCollectors.com Series 9 Neo Classics. It was modeled after the 1974 version with only one motor and renamed 'Mountain Goat'. Grass Hopper Description[] The Grass Hopper released in 1974 is&#160; a&#160; reissue of the cast Grass Hopper (1971), with major changes. The Cast lost the rear motor and canvas canopy, released in Enamel paint and with a large motor in front. A major change to the body removing all of the miner's tools that were part of the old body and Tampo's were added to the sides . Odd history with all that retooling of the casting. The very next year was the last we would see of the Grass Hopper, not before another casting change with the loss of the front motor. Aww but what other cast shows up in the line up? The Gun Slinger without the motor. The blister pack for 1974 was changed to a white back ground with cars (Baja Breaker,Heavy Chevy &amp; P-917) Flying off the card. The Card itself was 7\" x 4.5\" Gun Slinger Description[] The casting of this Gun Slinger is very similar to the casting for the Grass Hopper of 1971. The chief differences being that this model omits the hole in the hood for a blown engine to show through like it did in the earlier vehicle and the windshield is now just a frame and part of the interior piece. It has a huge, swivelling gun mounted in the rear and sticking out well past the front of the vehicle."

It is hard to trace the history of the name. The fact that the Formula Pack showed up mid- to late-1975 in the 6-pack, means the El Rey Special was only made for about a year and half.

The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept show car. Myron Scott is credited for naming the car after the type of small, maneuverable warship called a corvette. Originally built in Flint, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette is currently manufactured in Bowling Green, Kentucky and is the official sports car of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The third generation Corvette Stingray, patterned after the Mako Shark II concept car, was introduced for the 1968 model year and was in production until 1982. C3 (after Corvette 3rd generation) coupes featured the first use of T-top removable roof panels. For 1974, a new rear bumper system replaced the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights. The new rear design was quite beautiful, and more up-to-Base than the 60's shape that it replaced with the vast majority of enthusiasts embracing the new design. Tailpipes were now turned down as the new bumper cover eliminated the tailpipe extensions. This casting is modeled after a 1975 Corvette. It is similar to the later Corvette Stingray casting, which was based on a 1980's Corvette. There is also a modified 4x4 version of this casting named Monster Vette."

The Spoiler Sport was the most extreme custom van design created by Hot Wheels during this time period. Featuring an angular, wedge-shaped front reminiscent of an exotic European import, and a raised roofline behind the driving cab with 2 rectangular windows. The initial versions from 1977 to the 1979 Golden Machines 6-Pack versions all featured the same sunset/palm trees/beach mural with the text \"Spoiler Sport\" in black and a pinstripe down the sides of the body.

The original Hot Bird was made in Hong Kong, Malaysia and China. In 2006 a completely new casting was made and produced in both Malaysia and Thailand. This new casting was used from 2006 on. Although very similar to the original, the dimensions of the car differ. The first noticable difference is the size of the shaker scoop on the hood. The new version's shaker is slightly longer than the old. Also, both bases are different. A few other differences are the detail of the rear tail lights and the hood bird tampo. One constant similarity of both models through the years is they have both ALWAYS been all diecast.

The car was introduced on 10 September 1975 and was powered by a 5.3L Jaguar V12 initially with a choice between manual and automatic transmissions although the manual transmission was quickly dropped. The car was launched during a fuel crisis where demand for a large V12-powered sports car was understandably low; production was halted for half of 1981 to allow unsold stock to be moved. The car would be produced until 1996, with the car given a substantial facelift in 1991 by Jaguar's new owners Ford. 115,413 were produced.

Styled by Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina and built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, the 308 acted as Ferrari's new entry-level model, replacing the Dino 246; many of the 308's components were shared with the Dino, as well as a related car, the 308 GT4. The 308 was powered by a 2.9L F106AB V8 mated to a 5-speed manual and available in coupe and targa formats, named the 308 GTB and GTS respectively; the GTB was made available first at the 1975 Paris Motor Show while the GTS was introduced at the 1977 Frankfurt Motor Show. The GTB and GTS were discontinued in 1980 to make way for the 308 GTBi and GTSi models, essentially the same cars but with Bosch K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection. 2,897 308 GTBs were produced. This casting has been variously named the Race Bait 308 and Racebait 308; in later years this casting was named the Ferrari 308 or Ferrari 308 GTB. This casting originally had a plastic base before it was changed to metal in 1982. The casting was modified for use in the Power Command Racers series in 1990, now with a different plastic body, clockwork motor and a large wing. Said Power Command casting was later modified for use in the regular lineup, although this was short-lived."

First produced on October 20, 1927, but not sold until December 2, it replaced the venerable Model T, which had been produced for 18 years. By 4 February 1929, one million Model As had been sold, and by 24 July, two million. The engine was a water-cooled L-head inline 4-cylinder with a displacement of 201 cu in (3.3 l). This engine provided 40 hp (30 kW). Top speed was around 65 mph (105 km/h). The transmission was a conventional 3-speed sliding gear manual unsynchronised unit with a single speed reverse. The Model A had 4-wheel mechanical drum brakes. The 1930 and 1931 models were available with stainless steel radiator cowling and headlamp housings. This diecast model has a dump bed placed on the rear and the grille is placed forward, which means that there is some distance between the engine and the grille, resulting in extra cooling when hauling heavy loads."

The model kit was most likely inspired by the conversion kits available from Ecklers for the later era C3 Corvette body style with a fixed rear window. Later on Greenwood worked with Ecklers to develop a modified conversion kit for the earlier C3 models with removable rear windows. Together they often referred to as the Shooting Brake Corvettes and can still be occasionally found 'up for sale' among their other Corvette cousins. The Corvette design cues can be seen in the front nose details. On the hood with its iconic hidden headlights and the shortened cold air intake design at the base of the window. Along the curved front and rear fender arches. And at the front of the roof line you can see the classic Corvette T-top design with its roof panels out. At the rear end of the model the 4 round frenched taillights catch the eye and say Corvette to everyone it passes. There is a huge gas tank you can see in the back window. Letting this van always got some miles ahead of everyone else. A battery is mounted to the right side of the gas tank. The big block engine is also mounted inside the van portion of the casting just behind the front seats so that it matches up to the side exhaust tips.. Making this a mid-engined 'Vette Van.

In 1978 they took interest in the DeLorean car, which was getting significant media attention at the time. Joel Rubenstein, Product Legal at Mattel, received a verbal okay from DeLorean Motor Company to produce a Hot Wheels car based on the prototype DeLorean car. Working from photos of the prototype, the molds were quickly developed and samples created. For reasons that are still unclear (though a deal with Matchbox has been recently uncovered), DMC decided against allowing Mattel to manufacture the die-cast version of the car. To recoup the costs associated with the design and tooling, Bob convinced Mattel to modify the existing tooling to alter the appearance of the car just enough that it wasn't exactly a DeLorean any more. The version was re-named \"Turismo\" and sold in 1981. The gallery photos (courtesy Bob Rosas) of the silver car show one of the few surviving prototypes made from the unmodified tooling. In 2015, Hot Wheels paid tribute to Turismo with two new versions of the current DeLorean cast that replicated the red and yellow #10 paint job. One is gloss red, the other is Spectraflame."

The Cadillac Series 355 was manufactured by Cadillac from 1931 to 1935. They were 8-cylinder cars, sold in several models: a 2-door club coupe, a 2-door convertible, 4-door convertible, a 4-door sedan a 4-door town car and a 4-door limousine. The 1935 Model 355E was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by coachbuilder Fisher and on the Series 30 by coachbuilder Fleetwood. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was a feature of the overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and radiator filler cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side panel. The diecast model features two spare tires with covers, an open driver's compartment and an enclosed passenger compartment. The model has the distinct grille and hood louvers."

The MegaDestroyer props used in the film were custom-built by Frederick's Inc. using assembly-line construction techniques; the chassis was sourced from the San Fernando Buggy Center, the engines were Volkswagen flat-4s sourced from Bernie Bergmann Inc. and the transaxle from Transaxle Engineering Inc. For armament the MegaDestroyers featured laser cannons and rocket launchers which actually fired working solid-fuel rockets; the laser cannons worked through spark plugs igniting a flammable mixture to create the illusion of them firing, with electronics used to move the gun barrels; the laser beams were added to the movie in post. Actors would enter the vehicle through a gullwing door on the left hand side of the vehicle. Ten were built for the film but only two survived the shooting. Early prototypes of the Megadestroyer 1 and 2 used a Rock Buster chassis with what appears to either be resin or plasticine molded onto it to resemble the vehicle. After the initial two releases, the casting was released in the standard Hot Wheels lineup devoid of any references to Megaforce; it was subsequently renamed Super Cannon until 1995, when it was renamed Enforcer. The Enforcer name has been used for the vast majority of this casting's releases. This casting features a pivoting rear laser blaster which has been removed for a number of releases. It was removed permanently around 2011 and reappeared in 2013, albeit cast into the body. In 2011 the casting gained a plastic base."

This model was initially planned for retirement in 2005 as part of the Final Run Series but was replaced by Treadator due to unknown reasons. It has been retooled a number of times over its release. Since 2017 this model has been permanently referred to as Quick Bite. Good Humor Truck was featured in the Hot Wheels Let's Race television series driven by Coop, Spark, Mac, Brights, Axle Spoiler, Sidecar, and Uncle Larry."

It used an improved version of the Phantom I engine in an all-new chassis. The Phantom II used a refinement of the Phantom I's 7.7 L (7,668 cc or 467.9 cu in) pushrod-OHV straight-6 engine with a new crossflow cylinder head. Unlike on previous 40/50 hp models, the engine was bolted directly to the 4-speed manual transmission. Only the chassis and mechanical parts were made by Rolls-Royce. The body was made and fitted by a coachbuilder selected by the owner. Some of the most famous coachbuilders who produced bodies for Rolls Royce cars are Park Ward, Thrupp &amp; Maberly, Mulliner, Henley, and Hooper. This diecast model is most likely based on the 1931 Rolls-Royce Phantom II Continental Henley Roadster. It has a removable roof and spare tire covers.

The interior molding continues from front to back to form the fish's huge teeth and the car's two massive V8 engines and tail-pipes. The car's base extends to form the shark's lower jaw at the front and the tail at the rear. This unusual design means that certain versions actually have a tail and lower jaw that are a different color from the rest of the body. Unrealistically, the tail fin is horizontal, like that of a dolphin, rather than vertical like that of a real shark! (This is due to the way the car is designed.

The Countach could be ordered with an optional rear wing which improved high-speed stability decreased top speed; most buyers ordered the wing. Production of the LP 400S ended in 1982; 237 were produced. This die-cast model is based on the LP400 S model, released in 1978. [The tampos on some versions indicate \"LP500 S\" which was released in 1982.] Though the engine was slightly downgraded from the previous LP400 model (355&amp;nbsp;hp (261&amp;nbsp;kW)), the most radical changes were in the exterior, where the tires were replaced with 345/35R15 Pirelli P7 tyres; the widest tyres available on a production car at the time, and fiberglass wheel arch extensions were added, giving the car the fundamental look it kept until the end of its production run. An optional V-shaped spoiler was available over the rear deck, which, while improving high-speed stability, reduced the top speed by at least 16&amp;nbsp;km/h (10&amp;nbsp;mph). Most owners ordered the wing. Early castings of the die-cast model have the wing molded separately from the body.

Today, the F40 is one of Ferrari's most collectible models and is part of a group enthusiasts name the \"Big 5\", including itself, the 288 GTO, F50, Enzo Ferrari and LaFerrari. The Hot Wheels Ferrari F40 is known for its opening rear section to view the engine compartment similar to the real F40. In 2014, mid-way through its&#160;production for the Ferrari 5-Pack release, the Ferrari F40 was re-tooled to remove this opening feature. Other changes to the casting include closed headlights, a slightly wider&#160;body, shallower side air ducts, completely new window and interior sculpts and a plastic base. It is possible to find two versions of the 2014 Ferrari 5-Pack, with either the original F40 casting or the new replacement. This would be the final release of the Ferrari F40; no Ferraris would be released by Hot Wheels past the 2015 mainline lineup with the expiration of the license, with all tools likely destroyed."

The Chevrolet Monte Carlo is a two-door coupe that was produced by Chevrolet through six generations from the 1970 to the 2007 model years. It was marketed as a personal luxury car; the Monte Carlo had outlived many competitors that were either discontinued or changed in concept to either a four-door sedan or small sport coupe. For 1986, there was the new Aerocoupe model. The Aerocoupe was created by modifications to the Super Sport body, including a more deeply sloped rear window and a shorter trunk lid sporting a spoiler that lay more flat than previous Super Sports. Only 200 Aerocoupes were sold to the public, which happened to be the exact number NASCAR officials required for road model features to be incorporated into the racing cars. This diecast model is designed to look like a NASCAR race car. The doors are welded shut, a roll cage is installed, the interior is stripped and the windows are strengthened with vertical bars."

They were intended to establish exterior and interior design themes that would be modified for production versions of Pontiac sports cars. Known within General Motors as the \"Banshee IV\", this car was unveiled in 1988. The two-door, four-seat Banshee had a sleek and sensuous futuristic design. Its fiberglass body was painted bright red, while its triangular hood was matte black. A 230 horsepower fuel-injected, single overhead cam V8 engine powered the rear wheels. A heads-up display system projected information about speed, engine RPM, and fuel level on the windshield in the driver's field of vision. The dashboard featured video displays and numerous buttons; the steering wheel alone contained about twenty. The dual rear wings were also adjustable. Like its predecessors, it was intended to establish exterior and interior design themes that would be modified for the production version of the Pontiac Firebird. The Banshee successfully influenced the overall appearance for the fourth generation of the Firebird, as well as extending to the fourth generation of the Chevrolet Camaro. A vehicle heavily modeled after the Banshee IV appeared as the Knight Industries 4000 in the Knight Rider 2000 sequel TV movie, although a customized 1991 Dodge Stealth ES was actually used. The Banshee can also be seen in Back to the Future Part II and Demolition Man. This diecast model is an accurate representation of the Pontiac. One major difference is the partly hidden rear wheels on the real vehicle and the fully exposed wheels on the diecast model."

One of the most popular Hot Wheels castings, the '67 Camaro acts as a mainstay of the Hot Wheels lineup many years after its introduction.

The car was rated by the EPG at an impressive 88 mpg, although GM claimed it could go as high as 100 mpg if the car was coasting. The car was ultimately canceled; it being made largely of carbon fiber meant that the car could have never been affordable, and combined with new emissions regulations in California, GM switched their focus to their ultimately ill-fated EV1 project. Two cars were produced. Due to its unusual design, the Ultralite has found a home in many movies, usually acting as a futuristic mode of transportation.

The car would be showcased at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit; the car wowed the crowds but the critics were less pleased, mainly with the V6. It is said the engine was later replaced with a 5.7L LT1 V8. GM considered putting the Stingray III into production, but for a car that had a projected cost of $300,000, even if it could do some 225&#160;mph (362&#160;km/h), meant that few could afford it and the plug was pulled on production.

The car was intended to be equipped with a new 7.0L V8 with variable boost, capable of producing upwards of 1200 BHP; the prototypes however were fitted with the same V8 as the W8. The car was painted in aqua to assist in advertising the colors of Wiegert's other company, AquaJet, producing personalized watercraft; it was initially painted silver. A second roadster version, the WX-3R, was also produced; a total of two cars were produced. Both cars featured minor differences from each other. Wiegert had intended to produce the WX-3 but problems began to surface when MegaTech, an Indonesian company with Bermudan ties, forced a hostile takeover of the company, angering Wiegert and leading him to be fired from his own company. When the now MegaTech-owned Vector attempted to produce the WX-3, Wiegert had copyrighted the designs and Vector could not produce the car without his approval; this meant that the only WX-3s ever produced were the two cars produced when Wiegert was still at the helm of the company. Both are currently in private ownership, having been sold off by Wiegert to fund development of his next vehicle, the WX-8; development of the WX-8 would ultimately cease following Wiegert's death in January 2021."

The car is manufactured mostly out of carbon fiber and features a removable roof. With Ferrari policy dictating that they produce one less car than what demand required, 349 cars were produced in total.

Of course due to the fact that Hot Wheels does not want alcohol sponsors on their toy for little kids, the Budweiser sponsor was replaced with the \"Ford\" logo. This is not the only time Hot Wheels had to replace sponsors. Ricky Craven's #50 (and #25) Budwiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo Stocker had its sponsors replaced with \"Hendrick Motorsports\". Sterling Marlin's #40 Coor's Light '01 Dodge Intrepid Stock Car had its sponsors replaced with \"Sterling Marlin\". Rusty Wallace's #2 Miller Beer Pontiac Stocker has its sponsors replaced with \"Pontiac\". With all these changes it's a surprise that Hot Wheels kept Mark Martin's #6 Viagra Taurus Stocker as is. Also considering that the T-Bird Stocker (1994) features Bill Elliott's #94 McDonald's car and Bill Elliott's #94 Thunderbat car, it's no surprise that the #11 car from the Ford 5-Pack is based on a stocker Bill Elliott once drove."

The Countach 25th Anniversary was also the final variant of the Countach, being produced until 1990; it is said to be the fastest and most refined version of the Countach. 657 were produced. Different to the Lamborghini Countach from 1988, this version is based on the 25th Anniversary Lamborghini Countach without the enormous rear spoiler. It debuted in 1997 and has seen several versions since."

Styled by Leonardo Fioravanti of Pininfarina and hand-built by Carrozzeria Scaglietti, the 328 was essentially a heavy revision of the previous 308 with aesthetic changes and performance upgrades, most notably a new 3.2L F105CB V8 producing 266 horsepower mated to a 5-speed manual. The car was introduced at the 1985 Frankfurt Auto Show and was available in coupe and targa formats, dubbed the 328 GTB and 328 GTS respectively, following on from the 308 and previous cars. The 328 is widely considered one of Ferrari's most usable classic cars due to its durable road record, history of appreciating value and its aesthetics. 7,412 were produced, of which 1,344 were 328 GTBs. This casting is a modification of the Power Command Racers Ferrari 308 casting, featuring the removal of all Power Command-related features to facilitate its use in the mainline. As a result of it being included in the Power Command Racers series all releases of this casting do not feature an interior. This casting has never actually been referred to as the the Ferrari 328 in any official capacity, with any releases referring to this model by name referring to it as a Ferrari 308, but is named as such in this article and various other collector sites due to its passing resemblance to one."

The cars were revised for 1998, with one car being modified with an experimental hybrid system by David Price and Zytek and dubbed the Q9 GTR-1 Hybrid; performance of that car was poor and the project was summarily abandoned.

Its stunts were the highest of any vehicle in the game, earning it the title of \"The Stunt King.\""

    "desc": "The Porsche 911 GT1 was a sports prototype race car designed and manufactured by Porsche AG for use in sports car racing. Designed by Norbert Singer and Tony Hatter, the 911 GT1, despite sharing a name with the 911 road car, featured little in common with the road going car, with only the headlights and taillights shared. The car was powered by a 3.2L M96/80 twin-turbocharged flat-6; its frontal chassis was based on the 993 while its rear subframes and engine were derived from what was used in the 962C. Twenty-five road-going versions of the 911 GT1, named the 911 GT1 Straßenversion (lit. \"street version\"), were produced to homologate the car. The car made its debut in the 1996 BPR Global GT Series at Brands Hatch. The Porsche 911 GT1-98 was a further refinement of the 911 GT1 and the car's final variant overall, competing in the LMGT1 category. Despite sharing a similar name with the previous 911 GT1s, the 911 GT1-98 bore little resemblance to the previous two models, instead featuring new bodywork and paneling designed by Wiet Huidekoper that was more similar to that of a sports prototype than that of a grand touring race car. The car competed in the FIA International GT Series; it was the closest competition to Mercedes-Benz's CLK LM, but was not usually able to match it on most occasions due to engine regulations regarding air restrictors being unfavorable to turbocharged engines. Despite this, a 911 GT1-98 managed to win the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans due to its competitors having reliability problems. The cars were withdrawn from competition after the 1998 season. Five chassis were built, as well as one street-legal version used to homologate the car. Base is incorrectly named/spelled. Base reads as Porsche 911 GTI-98 with letter I not \"1\" , should be Porsche 911 GT1-98"

Designed by Gerhard Ungar, the CLK LM succeeded the CLK GTR, with which it had a passing resemblance visually but was unrelated mechanically. As required by FIA GT Championship regulations, a road version of the car had to be built to homologate the car; Mercedes-Benz built two chassis, known as the CLK LM Straßenversion, one of which was a crash test car. The CLK LM began competition in the 1998 FIA GT Championship, entering at the third round in Hockenheim, replacing the CLK GTRs which had raced the previous two races. Driven by Bernd Schneider, Mark Webber, Klaus Ludwig and Ricardo Zonta, the CLK LMs dominated the season, winning every race they entered, clinching both the Constructors' Championship for Team AMG-Mercedes and the Drivers' Championship for Ludwig and Zonta, both with significant margins over their next best competitors, Porsche. The cars also entered the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans; this run ended without success, with both cars retiring. The cars were retired after 1998, with entries for the GT1 class being so few thanks to fears of a repeat of Mercedes-Benz's dominance that the FIA decided to scrap the class altogether for 1999. The CLK LM would be replaced by the ill-fated CLR, which resulted in Mercedes-Benz's withdrawal from all sportscar activities that year. Four chassis were produced."

This casting is among the first widely released imported Tuner-type models. The car was also featured on Hot Wheels packaging from late 2000 to 2003. Tscherne says that the car was inspired by numerous tuner cars of the late '90s; not long after first drawing the car, he purchased a Mitsubishi Eclipse, with some lines from said car making it over to this model. The design is also said to be mostly inspired by a Wings West Aggressor-style bodykit. Intended to be \"the top of the tuner foodchain\", the Seared Tuner is fitted with an AWD drive system and a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4. The original design featured winglets to allow it to \"do some fun tricks with certain track pieces\". The name was originally Sho-Stopper, but it was changed to Seared Tuner after legal challenges arose. Over a year after its First Editions release, another toy company producing a line of dolls called Show-Stoppers confronted Mattel, which had the trademark to the name. Mattel changed the name to Seared Tuner (a pun on \"seared tuna\") to prevent further legal issues; Tscherne called the name \"disappointing\", calling it \"too punny and disrespectful of the culture at the time\"."

Hailing from the United Kingdom himself, this was Fraser's first vehicle attempt for the Hot Wheels basic line. His first idea was to have the engines up front and the cockpit over the rear wheels. There was a concern however that it beared too much resemblance to the existing Twin Mill and Twin Mill II castings, so a change was needed. Back at the drawing board and wanting to keep the elements of \"big engines, big power, and big attitude\", Fraser continued to toss the layout of his design around. Eventually, his final forward cockpit and mid-engined design made it into production as 2001 First Edition car called the Maelstrom. The Maelstrom has been said by some to resemble the Hairy Hauler or the Vulture. It also tends to bear some similarities to the Vector M12.

Introduced in 1967, the 330 P4 was powered by a 4.0L Tipo 237 V12 mated to a 5-speed ZF manual; the engine was radically redesigned by Franco Rocchi with three-valve cylinder heads. Compared to the previous P model, the 330 P3, the 330 P4 was shorter and more powerful, generating 444 horsepower compared to the P3's 412. Ferrari won the 1967 1000 km Monza and the 1967 24 Hours of Daytona with the 330 P4; in the latter race two 330 P4s and one 330 P3 crossed the finish line in a photo finish, in apparent response to Ford's photo finish with four GT40s at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans. Four chassis were built; it is said that three chassis are accounted for. The initial livery of this casting depicts chassis 0856, the car that finished third in the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Willy Mairesse and Jean Blaton (under the pseudonym \"Beurlys\"). Of note is there is no such thing as a P4 block; to save money Ferrari very cleverly cast blocks that could be built up as a 3L for F1, 3.3L for sports cars for races like on the Nürburgring and the Targa Florio where fuel consumption was very important because of the long laps. This was done in the same block by changing the piston skirt length, the crank journals's size and the rod length."

According to designer Eric Tscherne, Rockster was his take on a Jeep-like Hummer model, and was originally intended to have a full fabric roof with removable doors à la Jeep CJ-7. The front grille of the casting also resembled that of a Hummer, but featured raised slots as opposed to recessed ones; this was later changed to a generic grille on the request of GM. The name of the casting was actually intended to be Roxster but Hot Wheels's legal team forced the name change to Rockster. The logos on the side of the initial release were nods to members of his family. Despite the grille design change, the Micro Rev-Ups, Micro Madnetics, 2010 Rev-Ups castings of Rockster used the original vertical bar design.

Racing in the GT500 category, the NSX-GT shares few parts with its road-going counterpart and only bears a passing resemblance to it; the car is powered by a 3.5L V6 derived from the roadgoing C32B V6 using in its road-going counterpart. A predecessor of sorts to the NSX-GT was privately entered in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship by Team Kunimitsu in 1996, based on a GT2 car entered in the 24 Hours of Le Mans the year prior. Honda would officially enter the championship in 1997 using these Dome-built cars; while initially not competitive performance began to pick up and it eventually became one of the most successful cars in the series. The NSX-GTs would long outlast their road-going counterparts; after the NSX was discontinued in 2005, the NSX-GTs continued to compete. Four further revisions, colloquially named Phase 2 through Phase 5, were introduced in 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2007. When the NSX-GT was retired in 2009, it had won 36 races and achieved two drivers' and three teams' championships. For 2010, the car was replaced by the Honda HSV-010 GT, a bespoke racing car developed for Super GT by Honda with no road-going counterpart; the NSX would return to compete in the GT500 category in 2016, based on the then-new 2017 Honda NSX. This casting is a hybrid of a number of different NSX-GT models, featuring the general shape of the Phase 2 NSX-GTs but the top air scoop of the Phase 3 and onwards NSXs. This casting features a lightly sloped front bumper to allow it to negotiate loops and a different rear wing when compared to the real life NSX-GT. The casting was retooled in 2013, losing its plastic wing and having it cast into the body. The casting was given a wider stance and larger side splitter and skirts to resemble a racing NSX for its 2017 Race Day release."

The Ford Torino Talladega was a special version of the Torino Cobra (a performance package) produced only between January and February 1969. Named for the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama, the Torino Talladega would be considered a homologation special in today's terms, for it was produced due to homologation rules to allow Ford to compete in NASCAR racing. Powered by the 428 ci (7.0L) FE Cobra Jet V8, the Torino Talladega is now considered the first member of the Aero Warriors, a nickname given to four muscle cars (Ford Torino Talladega, Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird) designed specifically to race in NASCAR. The Torino Talladega was highly successful, winning 29 Grand National races before NASCAR essentially banned the Aero Warriors from competing come 1970. Today, the Torino Talladega, and its sibling, the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler II, are often considered to be highly undervalued for what they had achieved in racing; despite this they are still highly collectible cars, with few examples existing today.

The car's name is speculated to be a combination between \"gazelle\" and \"Chevrolet\", with Chevrolet seemingly positioning this car as a smaller version of the Impala. The car was introduced in August 1963 by Chevrolet CEO Bunkie Knudsen as the Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu, for it was essentially a performance version of the Malibu. The Chevelle Super Sport, commonly shortened to Chevelle SS, was a performance-oriented version of the Chevelle, acting as Chevrolet's entrance into the muscle car battle. The package, costing $162, featured SS emblems on the car in various places, interior improvements such as an upgraded gauge cluster, two transmission options (a Muncie 4-speed manual or a 2-speed Powerglide automatic) and a 283 ci (4.6L) Small-Block V8.

The car is powered by the 2JZ 3.0L inline-6, available in naturally-aspirated and twin-turbocharged iterations. This generation of Supra had Toyota place more emphasis on a more serious high-powered car. Since its discontinuation in 2002, the A80 Supra has gained a cult following among automotive enthusiasts and the modification scene, especially after its appearances in mass media such as Initial D and the Fast &amp; Furious franchise. This casting depicts a lightly-modified 1994 Toyota Supra with what appears to be a generic bodykit and hood similar to a Ridox design and a rear wing similar to ones offered by APR Performance. The initial livery of the casting was based on Brian O'Conner's 1994 Toyota Supra from the film The Fast &amp; The Furious; subsequent versions of the Supra depicting Supras from the film series include Slap Jack's Supra in 2 Fast 2 Furious (recycled from Supras from the first movie) and Brian's personal Supra from Furious 7.

Jones took a Custom Beetle and added some parts to the underside and the back. The Käfer Racer appears to have taken inspiration from a VW Beetle Super Saloon and VWs racing in the Fun Cup. The first release was inspired by the Momo-sponsored Porsche 935/78-81 'Moby Dick' raced by Gianpiero Moretti in the IMSA GT series in the early 1980s. The car has downforce tunnels on the underside of the Beetle, a V8 engine with two exhaust pipes sticking out, and an air scoop on the roof."

After seeing a toaster he thought, Hmm, what if I put the wheels on a toaster? When the wing is pressed down, the bread drops down in the toaster.

Designed by Hirotoshi Honda, son of Soichiro Honda, the City Turbo II was an intercooled version of the previous City Turbo II, which was in turn a performance-oriented version of the first generation Honda City. The City Turbo II was fitted with a 1.2L ER turbocharged inline-4 and fitted with flared fenders and a number of other aesthetic changes; its wider stance and appearance caused the car to be nicknamed \"Bulldog\" by enthusiasts. The City was designed to be sold along with a small foldable motor scooter named the Motocompo and designed to fit in the trunk of the vehicle. Production of the first generation City ended in October 1986. The City Turbo also spawned a one-make racing series held in the 1980s called the Honda City Turbo Cup, run by Honda and Honda tuning company Mugen Motorsports. The cars were given more extreme aerodynamics, a more aggressive bodykit and a modified engine, now making 138 horsepower. It is said that most of the cars were purchased by an Australian entrepreneur who wanted to continue the series in Australia; at the time, the cars were stored in a warehouse in Japan. It is alleged that as the cars were waiting to be shipped the Great Hanshin earthquake struck and destroyed the cars. One example is preserved in the Honda Collection Hall in Suzuka. This casting depicts a Honda City Turbo II with the bodykit of the Turbo Cup cars. As stated by the card back of the New Models version a Motocompo can be seen in the rear. There are a number of variations on the casting having a detailed Honda badge cast into the front and rear."

Debuting at the 1965 Turin Auto Show where it wowed the crowds with its sleek design and revolutionary mid-engined design, the car's mid-engined layout eventually became the standard for high-performance supercars and was the fastest production car on its introduction. Allegedly, the car was designed against Ferruccio Lamborghini's wishes, who preferred grand tourers over race car-derived and inspired machines. Production ended in 1973 with 764 produced. The base of the casting reads '71 Lamborghini Miura P400SV."

The CB750F was a café racer-styled version of the CB750, produced from 1975 to 1978. After it was discontinued the CB750 was replaced by the CB900F. This casting features a kickstand for display purposes. This casting introduces the MCCR wheel."

First introduced on 29 September 1966, the Camaro has become one of the most recognizable muscle cars. The name \"Camaro\" does not appear to mean anything and was likely chosen to continue Chevrolet's trend of naming cars starting with the letter \"C\"; a GM executive, when asked the question, jokingly claimed that a Camaro was \"a small, vicious animal that eats mustangs\". This casting, while similar to the original '67 Camaro and Custom Camaro castings, is an entirely new cast; it features a new hood scoop and new base along with side pipes and is intended to be a representation of sorts of a Yenko Camaro. This casting is likely intended to be a representation of the 1967 Chevrolet Camaro in the Hot Wheels Garage of Legends. This casting was intended to be introduced in the Hot Wheels id series but was not released in any of the mixes before the cancelation of the line.
